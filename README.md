# Solar System Project - Three.js

## Description

This is an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system, made with Three.js.The simulation accurately depicts the natural processes of planetary motion and gravitational interactions, allowing users to observe and understand the dynamic relationships among the planets, moons, and the sun.

## Features

- Celestial Body Representation:
    - Accurate portrayal of celestial bodies, including their sizes, colors, and textures.
    - Detailed visual representations of planets, moons, and the sun contribute to a realistic simulation.

- Orbital Motion Simulation:
    - Dynamic simulation of the orbital motion of planets and moons around the sun.
    - Realistic gravitational interactions provide an authentic experience of celestial bodies in motion.
  
- Interactive Navigation:
    - User-friendly controls for navigation and exploration of the solar system.
    - Zoom in/out features enable users to observe celestial bodies from varying perspectives.
  
- Information Display:
    - Essential information about each celestial body, such as name, distance from the sun, and orbital period, is displayed.
    - Users can gain insights into the characteristics and properties of the planets and moons.

- Interactive Experiments:
    - Engaging scenarios and experiments allow users to manipulate variables and observe their impact on planetary motion.
    - Learn about gravity, orbital mechanics, and other celestial phenomena through interactive simulations.
